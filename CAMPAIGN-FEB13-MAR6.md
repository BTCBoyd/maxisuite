## 📈 How Posts Auto-Load

### Technical Implementation
**File:** `js/auto-import-full-campaign.js`

**How it works:**
1. On first page load, checks if campaign already imported
2. If not, loads all 52 posts from `fullCampaignData` array
3. Compares scheduled time to current time
4. Posts already passed → mark as "posted"
5. Posts in future → mark as "scheduled"
6. Saves to localStorage under `maxisuite-queue` key
7. Sets import flag to prevent duplicate imports

**Pages updated:**
- `index.html` (compose)
- `queue.html` (post queue)
- `calendar.html` (calendar view)

**All pages now load the full campaign automatically.**

## 🔄 How to Edit/Extend Campaign

### To Add More Posts:
1. Edit `js/auto-import-full-campaign.js`
2. Add new post objects to `fullCampaignData` array
3. Follow same structure:
   ```javascript
   {
     date: "2026-03-07",
     time: "10:00",
     platforms: { x: true, nostr: false, linkedin: false },
     account: "@Maxibtc2009",
     content: "Post text here...",
     type: "thought-leadership"
   }
   ```
4. Commit changes
5. Deploy to Netlify
6. Users need to clear localStorage and reload OR manually add posts via UI

### To Reset Campaign:
Open browser console on MaxiSuite:
```javascript
localStorage.removeItem('maxisuite-campaign-imported-full');
localStorage.removeItem('maxisuite-queue');
location.reload();
```

Campaign will re-import with updated data.
